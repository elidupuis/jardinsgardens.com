# Dandelion Salad with Citrus Dressing

The light citrus dressing goes just right with the tangy, bitter taste of the dandelion leaves.

## Ingredients

*   2 cups (500 ml) fresh spinach
*   1/2 cup (125 ml) alfalfa sprouts
*   1/2 cup (125 ml) red onion, finely diced
*   1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh parsley, finely chopped
*   1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh dandelion petals, for garnish

### Dressing

*   1/2 cup (125 ml) fresh orange juice
*   2 Tbsp (30 ml) fresh lemon juice
*   1/3 cup (80 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
*   2 Tbsp (30 ml) pumpkin seed oil
*   2 Tbsp (30 ml) flax seed oil
*   2 Tbsp (30 ml) fresh lemon thyme
*   2 Tbsp (30 ml) fresh lemon balm
*   1/2 clove garlic, minced
*   1/2 tsp (2 ml) herbal salt, such as Herbamare or Country Sunâ€¨Pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
