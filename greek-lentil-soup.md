# Greek Lentil Soup

A perennial favourite from _The New Laurel’s Kitchen_ (it works well in a slow cooker too, just use a cup or so less water).

<!-- "A thinner, more flavorful version of lentil soup than the usual stewy kind." -->

## Ingredients

*   2 cups uncooked lentils
*   8 cups water or vegetable stock
*   ½ onion, chopped
*   1 small carrot, chopped
*   1 celery stalk, chopped
*   1 small potato, chopped
*   2 tablespoons olive oil
*   2 bay leaves
*   1 ½ to 2 teaspoons salt
*   2 teaspoons red wine vinegar

## Directions

1.  Pick over lentils and wash.
2.  Mix all ingredients except the vinegar in a soup pot and cook until the lentils are very soft, about one hour. Stir in vinegar at the end and serve.
3.  Makes about 8 cups, to serve 6.
