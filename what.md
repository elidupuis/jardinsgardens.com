# our gardens

**What We Do**: We build a raised garden bed at your home and give you the means to start growing your own food. We consult with you to find the best location on your property for your salad garden. We build it using environmentally sustainable lumber, fill it with fertile growing medium and get you started with seeds and seedlings. We follow up with seasonal growing tips and delicious recipes. All you have to do is plant it and water it. We will show you how.
