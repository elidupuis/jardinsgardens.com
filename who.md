# tiny green footprint

Located in Penticton, British Columbia, we are a small family company with a big vision. With the birth of our baby in 2008, we asked ourselves what we could do to make the world a better place. Then we asked ourselves what happened to the family vegetable patch. We believe that if we all start growing our own food again we can positively change the world we live in. A small salad garden for each family would reconnect us to our food supply and planet, save money, reduce our footprint and bring us good health. We can grow and harvest a great amount of produce and enjoy a great number of salads from just a small 4' x 4' garden plot, an area that any family can manage without difficulty. We hope to give people the nudge they need to start growing their own food. And we hope that once they get a taste of it (their own homegrown food that is) they might, just maybe, want to grow more of it.

> **Our Vision**: To live in a world full of happy people harvesting salads right outside their door.
